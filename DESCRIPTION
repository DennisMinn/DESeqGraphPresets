Description:  This is a collection of graphs that allow the user to emphasize specific genes within the
  data created by DESeq2. These graphs parallel that of those found online on either the DESeq2 
  vignette or BioConductor course material, but requires less knowledge about R's code and data manipulation. Hopefully,
  this simplifies and expedites the process of visualizing data.
